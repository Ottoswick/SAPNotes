- **Organizational Unit**: Organizational grouping of enterprise areas which, for legal reasons or for other specific business-related reasons or purposes, are grouped together. Organizational units are mapped to the system Enterprise Structure and include legal entities (Company Codes), Sales Offices, and Profit Centers.
- **Master Data**: Data which is used long-term in the system for several business processes.  Examples include Customers, Materials, and Vendors.
- **Transactions**: Application programs which execute business processes in the system such as creating a customer order, posting an incoming payment, or approving a leave request.
- **Document**: A data record that is generated when a transaction is carried out.
- **Reports**: Program which reads certain data elements and displays them in a list.
