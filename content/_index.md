# Introduction

## What's the point?

I am using this blog as a way to capture my notes whilst learning SAP both formally and on the job. A colleague has kindly provided me with SAP training material which I am using as the basis of my study and notes to be captured herein. As I progress through SAP training materials I will record my notes on this blog as preparation for the relevant SAP certification exam.

My plan is to study the following SAP modules (in order); Sales and Distribution, Finance, and then Profitability Analysis. The SAP exams relevant to these modules, and that I intend to sit, are:

-  [SAP S/4HANA Sales 1909](https://training.sap.com/certification/c_ts462_1909-sap-certified-application-associate---sap-s4hana-sales-1909-g/) ; and
- [Central Finance in SAP S/4HANA](https://training.sap.com/certification/c_s4fcf_1809-sap-certified-application-associate---central-finance-in-sap-s4hana-g/).


## Getting started

First things first, we need a SAP environment to play in. I am fortunate enough that I am currently working on a SAP implementation and so have access to an sandbox environment. If the sandbox was not available to me, [Michael Management](https://www.michaelmanagement.com/sap-access.asp) monthly subscription has been recommended to me as a cheap solution.  

The system I am using is SAP S/4HANA 1909 with Fiori, although I am not accessing the system through Fiori and will primarily be using the graphical user interface (GUI).
