# Introduction

## What's the point?

I am using this blog as a way to capture my notes whilst learning SAP both formally and on the job. A colleague has kindly provided me with SAP training material which I am using as the basis of my study and notes to be captured herein. As I progress through SAP training materials I will record my notes on this blog as preparation for the relevant SAP certification exam.

My plan is to study the following SAP modules (in order); Sales and Distribution, Finance, and then Profitability Analysis. The SAP exams relevant to these modules, and that I intend to sit, are:

-  [SAP S/4HANA Sales 1909](https://training.sap.com/certification/c_ts462_1909-sap-certified-application-associate---sap-s4hana-sales-1909-g/); and
- [Central Finance in SAP S/4HANA](https://training.sap.com/certification/c_s4fcf_1809-sap-certified-application-associate---central-finance-in-sap-s4hana-g/).

## What is SAP?

When referring to SAP I am referring to SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), being the SAP system ERP Central Component (SAP ECC). ERP provides an integrated and continuously updated view of core business processes using common databases maintained by the database management system. SAP ECC tracks business resources (cash, raw materials, production capacity) and the status of business commitments (orders, purchase orders, and payroll). The modules that make up the system share data across various departments (manufacturing, purchasing, sales, accounting, etc.) that provide the data.

## Getting started

First things first, we need a SAP environment to play in. I am fortunate enough that I am currently working on a SAP implementation and so have access to an sandbox environment. If the sandbox was not available to me, [Michael Management](https://www.michaelmanagement.com/sap-access.asp) monthly subscription has been recommended to me as a cheap solution.  

The system I am using is SAP S/4HANA 1909 with Fiori, although I am not accessing the system through Fiori and will primarily be using the graphical user interface (GUI).
