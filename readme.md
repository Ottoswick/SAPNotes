<h1>SAP Notes</h1>

<body>This is a beginners journey through the steep learning curve of 1. website building and 2. SAP (the chosen subject matter). For the SAP learning, I am utilising SAP resources for ECC6 and then reviewing changes in the new SAP S/4HANA system.

I am an accountant that is working on a SAP S/4HANA design and implementation project in the UK and am using the opportunity to look under the hood of SAP an learn as much as I can about the configuration of this ERP system to support my understanding of design decisions and to enable me to provide a better service to the end client.</body>

<h3>Desired outcomes</h3>
<body>In the sandbox system that is available to my team, I wan to be able to configure the system to evidence our core design decisions for:</body>

<ol>
<li>Sales & Distribution (SD)</li>
<li>Finance (FI)</li>
<li>COPA</li>
</ol>

<h3>Timeline</h3>
<body>My current contract is due to expire at the end of August 2020 and so this seems to be an appropriate time deadline. For SD learning, I would like to complete my learning guide by 29 May 2020. I will use the remaining three months to complete my learning resources for FI.</body>

<body>Recording this learning in a Hugo website, deployed on Netlify is an additional experiment for laughs.</body>
